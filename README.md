# Healthcare Analysis using Software Aid
Fittness is one of the major concerns of present time. Healthcare Analysis to measure certain parameters has been done in MFDM repository. The personâ€™s fitness statistics is used for further facts analysis, as next step of the project. The version is skilled with supervised classification algorithms namely, Classification. 

In this part of the project, a Machine Learning based model is employed to detect the probability of diabetes for an individual.
