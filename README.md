# Healthcare Analysis using Software Aid
Fittness is one of the major concerns of present time. Healthcare Analysis to measure certain parameters has been done in MFDM repository. The person’s fitness statistics is used for further facts analysis, as next step of the project. The version is skilled with two supervised classification algorithms namely, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Random Forest. The classical non-parametric choice tree getting to know techniques are classification and regression trees. The consumer’s health facts are trans-fashioned to either regression or classification, primarily based on numeric or specific component of the dependent variable respectively.
 
In this part of the project, a Machine Learning based model is employed to detect the probability of diabetes for an individual.
